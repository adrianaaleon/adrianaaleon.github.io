    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Indigenous groups inhabited central and southern Chile for several thousands of years, living in mixed pastoralist 
        and settled communities, ending with the Inca ruling the north of the country for nearly a century prior to the arrival 
        of the Spanish in the 16th century. The Captaincy General of Chile was founded by the Spanish in 1541, lasting until Chile 
        declared its independence in 1810. The subsequent struggle became tied to other South American independence conflicts, with 
        a decisive victory over the Spanish not being achieved until 1818.</p>

    <p> In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia to win its current northernmost regions. By the 1880s, 
        the Chilean central government cemented its control over the central and southern regions inhabited by Mapuche Indigenous peoples. 
        Between 1891 and 1973, a series of elected governments succeeded each other until the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador 
        ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by General Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a democratically elected president 
        was inaugurated in 1990. </p>

    <p> Economic reforms, maintained consistently since the 1980s, contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and helped 
        secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international 
        leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.</p>
